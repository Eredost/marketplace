## Installation

Before you can download the project you must first have a PHP version at least 7.3X and a recent version of Composer.

To set up the project, follow the steps below :

1. Clone the repository
2. Move your current directory to the root of the project
3. Perform the command :

        composer install
4. Create a new file ``.env.local`` and add the line below by changing the user's name and password as well as the name of the database.

        DATABASE_URL=mysql://db_user:db_password@127.0.0.1:3306/db_name
5. Finally, all you have to do is set up the database, associated tables and fixtures with the following commands :

        php bin/console doctrine:database:create
        php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
        php bin/console doctrine:fixtures:load
6. Two choices are available to you to start the project locally. You can first go through the Apache server but you will need to download a dependency beforehand :

        composer require apache-pack
        
   Or you can go directly to the pre-installed symfony server and go to the localhost address it has indicated :
   
        php bin/console server:run
        
**And it's over !**

## Contributions

To contribute to the project, you will have to follow a set of rules so that the project progresses in the best conditions.

- It is strictly forbidden to push directly on the **master**. Any changes will have to be made through **branches** and **pull requests**.

- Name your branches so that they are easily traceable and identifiable for everyone (example: fixtures).

- Commits must be fully written in **English** and must be sufficiently explicit. An [Buzut article](https://buzut.net/git-bien-nommer-ses-commits/) to have some commit naming tips.

- The comments in the code aren't optional, without going overboard, try to find a happy medium. Same rule as for the commits, they will be named in **English** (as well as the variables, constants etc ...).

- The pull requests must be initiated when you are sure that you have finished all of your modifications, they will be examined before being merged on the **master** definitively.
